# Shader Graph Example Library

![Player Lineup](https://i.imgur.com/kASJxN1.png)

**Description**

This project is a library of different custom shaders created using [Unity's Shader Graph feature](https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-shader-graph.511960/). All of the shaders are compatible for the [Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline](https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-scriptable-render-pipelines.470095/).

These Shader Graphs are provided as-is; so your mileage may vary! You are more than welcome to modify/change/extract/use any of the examples.

Contains examples for:
- Mesh Renderers/Skinned Mesh Renderers (located in ExampleScene-Player)
- Simple Particles
- Procedural Graphs and Animations (Using no Textures)
- Sprites
- Some 'Scenarios' such as Triplanar Grass and Vertex Offset Sine Wave


**Software Requirement**

- Version: Unity 2018.3.0f2
- Package: com.unity.render-pipelines.lightweight: 4.6.0-preview


**Known Issues**

There is sometimes an issue when opening the project for the first time that textures set in the Material Inspector aren't being applied properly; the current 'fix' is to open the related Shader Graph, click the "Save' button and the Material should update. :)
